Sometimes you need to see a tool in action to understand how you can apply it to your own investigations. That's why I took a trip to Spokane, WA, USA to capture this photo.

If you've opened [OSM Finder](https://osm-finder.netlify.app/) recently, you might recognize it as the site's new placeholder image. This image is full of information that would normally make it trivial to geolocate its origin using traditional techniques. Still, it's nearly a perfect image to demonstrate the capabilities of OSM Finder.

There are several specific items of interest that we'll be covering in this article and future articles.

We'll cover items 1 through 3 in this introductory article. We'll hopefully go over item 4 at some point in the distant future, but searching for shapes is a difficult problem that [hasn't yet been implemented](https://xetnus.github.io/blog/introducing-osm-finder-beta/#future-work). Items 5 and 6 will be demonstrated in another article coming out within the next few days. Finally, item 7 is what kicks off this investigation. It's a billboard that, very conveniently, tells us which state to start our search in.
