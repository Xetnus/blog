title: Introducing OSM Finder Beta
categories: [osm-finder, beta]
---

After four months of part-time development, OSM Finder is ready to enter the beta phase. OSM Finder has transitioned from a hardly functioning prototype that (by some miracle) won [Bellingcat's Digital Investigations Hackathon](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/10/06/automated-map-searches-scam-busting-tools-and-twitter-search-translations-here-are-the-results-of-bellingcats-second-hackathon/) to a functional (although still a bit clunky) geolocation tool.

## Demonstration

During a recent trip to Spokane, WA, USA, I took this picture from a hotel and uploaded it as the default image that loads when you open [OSM Finder](https://osm-finder.netlify.app/).
