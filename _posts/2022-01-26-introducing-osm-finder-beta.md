title: Introducing OSM Finder Beta
categories: [osm-finder, beta, update]
---

After four months of part-time development, OSM Finder is ready to enter the beta phase. OSM Finder has transitioned from a hardly functioning prototype that (by some miracle) won [Bellingcat's Digital Investigations Hackathon](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/10/06/automated-map-searches-scam-busting-tools-and-twitter-search-translations-here-are-the-results-of-bellingcats-second-hackathon/) to a functional and powerful (although still a bit clunky) geolocation tool.

## Updates

- A revamped user interface with fancy new colors, buttons, and other gadgets to play with, based on the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/).
- A "downsampling" capability that allows certain OpenStreetMap `way` types, like buildings, to be queried as nodes.
- Support for many more linestring and node types.
- A new default photo, which will be the basis for some instructional blog posts in the near future.
- And finally, this blog is live! I plan to use this blog for dev and update logs, as well as for demonstrating real-world use cases for OSM Finder.
